//Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from 1 to 16 (in any order) 
//then_ displays the numbers in a 4 by 4 arrangement, followed by the sums of the rows
//columns, and diagonals [without Array]:

//Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:
//16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1

//16  3  2 13
// 5 10 11  8
//9  6  7 12
// 4 15 14  1

//Row sums: 34 34 34 34
//Column sums: 34 34 34 34
//Diagonal sums: 34 34
//If the row, column, and diagonal sums are all the same (as they are in this example), 
//the numbers are said to form a magic square. The magic square shown here appears 
//in a 1514 engraving by artist and mathematician Albrecht DÃ¼rer. 
//(Note that the middle numbers in the last row give the date of engraving.)
